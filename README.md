# HelaSentiLex (Hela Sentiment Lexicon)
Python API for Sinhala Sentiment Lexicon with 14000+ sentiment tagged Sinhala words

### Setup environment
1. Make sure you have Python >= 3.6 by `python --version`
2. Additionally, you’ll need to make sure you have pip available by running `pip --version`
3. To install pip see [installing pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
4. Install helasentilex package using the command `pip install helasentilex`

### Getting started
Let's begin with showing how easy it is to find sentiments of Sinhala words using helasentilex
```
>>> import helasentilex
>>> helasentilex.sentiment('යහපත්')
1
>>> helasentilex.sentiment('අමිහිරි')
-1
>>> helasentilex.sentiment('පුටුව')
0
```

If the input word does not exist in our sentiment lexicon or the input is invalid then it will return `None`
```
>>> helasentilex.sentiment(23)
None
```

You can enter a sentence as a string and get sentiment scores for available words in the sentiment lexicon
```
>>> helasentilex.sentiments('ඔබේ සැප දුක කෙසේද')
{'ඔබේ': 0, 'සැප': 1, 'දුක': -1, 'කෙසේද': None}
```

If the input is invalid then it will return an empty dictionary
```
>>> helasentilex.sentiments(23)
{}
```

### Defining labels
```
 1: POSITIVE (ධනාත්මක)
-1: NEGATIVE (ඍණාත්මක)
 0: OBJECTIVE (මධ්‍යස්ථ හෝ උදාසීන)
```
